# Space Tourism Website

I have built the Space Tourism website. The website is responsive, you can use it on your phone, tablet or normal desktop.
Here is the link: https://space-tourism-six-ebon.vercel.app/

## TechStack

- React
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the app
